Live Energy Monitor
Weâ€™ve developed a Live Energy Monitor designed to address the problem of energy over-expenditure. This device provides real-time monitoring of electricity usage, allowing users to track and manage their energy consumption more efficiently. By giving instant feedback on usage patterns, it helps reduce unnecessary power waste, promotes energy-saving habits, and ultimately lowers electricity bills.
